Why are you taking the class and what are you expect to learn from it?

I am from the Department of Human Development and Family Science. Unfortunately, our department does not offer courses specifically in data science or machine learning, which are areas of great interest to me. I am eager to expand my knowledge in these fields, as they have significant applications in my research area. By learning more about data analysis and machine learning in your class, I hope to better analyze and interpret the datasets I work with.

Last semester, I took a Machine Learning class with Dr. Dobler, which was incredibly informative. That course broadened my perspective beyond classical methods, introducing me to modern approaches for cleaning, balancing, analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting data. While I am relatively new to this field, I am aware that there is still a vast amount of knowledge for me to acquire.

I am curious whether machine learning algorithms can be used to compare two or more groups, as most models I have encountered are focused on regression and correlation-based designs. I would like to learn how to apply machine learning techniques to address questions of causal inference and group comparisons. I also need to learn about machine learning approaches that focus on interpretation which is crucial for clinicians, scholars, and policymakers.

Thank you so much!
