John and I have done all tasks of Homework 5 together. We met over Zoom to address issues and work through the analysis collaboratively. We selected DC and MN. After running Random Forest Regressors, we evaluated model performance and examined feature importance. Notably, we observed a similarity in feature importance across the two models, with Greenhouse Gas emissions emerging as the most significant predictor in both models.
